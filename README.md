# Week 4 Sprint 
Capstone Projekt 
Sprint Week 4


Background

Berlin is one of the vegan food capitals of the world. One can find a vegan variation from curry wurst and döner to high class restaurants. Asian vegan food is also widely available across the city. 

This project aims to estimate the best localization to open a new vegan business in Berlin. 

Prior launching any restaurant, it’s important to know if the business as a good opportunity. In order to do so, this report will try to gather data about other restaurants and the best place to open a vegan food restaurant with the intent of focusing on vegan food. 

These data could be use for a business plan afterward. 

Problem

It is relevant to understand where are the best locations. With the market already saturated, it would be interesting to understand if there are places in the city that are underserved. To produce this research, data will be gathered on the existing competiton in the market. 


Data

The following data will be used. 

    Country/City: Berlin
    Goal: Vegan restaurants
